According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a payday loan is a small, short-term, unsecured loan with a high annual percentage rate (APR). It gets its name from the fact that borrowers essentially trade a portion of their next paycheck for early access to the same amount of money (minus the cost of any fees).

While loan terms can vary between lenders, a typical payday loan has:2

A maximum loan amount of $500
A repayment term of two to four weeks (i.e., a standard pay period)
A lump-sum repayment structure
Authorization for automatic repayment, usually through either a postdated check or an electronic bank account withdrawal
A high APR relative to the size of the loan, potentially in the triple digits
No credit check requirement
