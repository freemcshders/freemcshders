 According to a 2025 study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, payday lending did increase during the Great Recession. However, because the researchers lacked payday lending data from years prior to 2007, it’s uncertain whether the increase was a continuation of an ongoing trend or directly related to the recession. That said, the researchers also found that more middle-income borrowers have been taking out payday loans since 2007.

Meanwhile, a 2020 report from the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation found that Californians’ reliance on payday loans actually dropped during the 2020 recession, likely as a result of pandemic-related government assistance.5 In other words, other forms of financial relief can help stave off and even lower the use of payday loans during recessions.
